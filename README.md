## About the Video Course
In this course we'll discover how Cloud9 works, how we can get access to an environment, and how to get a work space setup for Google App Engine/Java development. What’s great about Cloud 9 online IDE is that your environment is running on a virtual machine in the cloud and is fully configured for you by default in under a minute! Everything is provisioned for you in Cloud 9 with proven, compatibility-tested versions of everything, across the board. What’s also nice is you can access your Cloud environment from any browser, any where, on any device and you can share your environment with other developers for code review and/or paired programming. Working with an online IDE versus working with a typical hard-installed client is a similar experience as coding goes. But, when it comes to testing, running a localhost server, networking and some other subtle tasks, things go a bit differently because your environment is in your browser with Cloud 9. We'll learn the ins and outs of coding in the cloud and see just how efficient it can be.
